======================== POWERSHELL ================================

most wmiobjects are Win32_ (means they only works on windows) which pulls information straight from the kernel about objects as opposed to just running the normal command to receive that information 

should not see pipes when viewing the processes

there are differences between user profiles in Powershell, Powershell ISE, and the newest version of powershell
start powershell -noprofile will load powershell without a profile
look for a powershell command ran with -windowstyle Hidden which means something is being hidden from you
can also change the version of the powershell you are about to run with -version <version number>

get-item WSMAN:\localhost\client\trustedhosts ping trusted hosts that can be Winrm'd into, can also use set item instead of give to set a trusted host make sure to add -concatenate to add as opposed to overwrite

invoke-command -comptername pwnd_host { restart-computer } -asjob 
invoke-command -computername a workstation,server C:\windows\findevil.ps1 
invoke-command is used to run commands remotely on other workstations with a small session while new-pssession which creates a more permanent session with the remote device
