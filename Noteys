======================== POWERSHELL ================================

most wmiobjects are Win32_ (means they only works on windows) which pulls information straight from the kernel about objects as opposed to just running the normal command to receive that information 

should not see pipes when viewing the processes

there are differences between user profiles in Powershell, Powershell ISE, and the newest version of powershell
start powershell -noprofile will load powershell without a profile
look for a powershell command ran with -windowstyle Hidden which means something is being hidden from you
can also change the version of the powershell you are about to run with -version <version number>

get-item WSMAN:\localhost\client\trustedhosts ping trusted hosts that can be Winrm'd into, can also use set item instead of give to set a trusted host make sure to add -concatenate to add as opposed to overwrite

invoke-command -comptername pwnd_host { restart-computer } -asjob 
invoke-command -computername a workstation,server C:\windows\findevil.ps1 
invoke-command is used to run commands remotely on other workstations with a small session while new-pssession which creates a more permanent session with the remote device

========================== WINDOWS REGISTRY ==============================

the registry is a heirarchial database that stores system wide settings as well as profile settings

hive keys always start with HKEY and are the main big groups of data like HKEY_Current_User or HKEY_Local_Machine
Registry keys are basically directories or subdirectories (subkeys) 
Registry values are the actual entries that contain data which can be read

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT is a symbolic link to the classes subkey in in HKEY_Local_Machine which contains all the file extensions and what file pertains to them
ren can rename file extensions to change their extension to whatever you want ex calc.exe to calc.lol
classes have to have a default key with an actual value which defaults to string upon creation unless specified otherwise
the default key in classes describes what the files with said extension should be treated like ex an exefile which is executable which also needs a specific designation since there are many different executable types in windows

HKEY_Local_Machine is just the local machine settings

HKEY_CurrentUser is a symbolic link to the HKEY_Users key containing the settings for the currently logged in user

HKEY_Users has the normal settings for every user sorted by their sid and a classes key which specifies how you choose to open your extensions

only Admins can open and change any other HKEY then the one for their user account

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE KEYS
even administrators cant view the SAM key which holds security tokens and usernames for every user account
BCD00000000 deals with the boot configuration of the system
Hardware has drivers and other such hardware related data
Security contains the lsass configuration data
System has the boot or driver startup applications
Software has the system wide user downloaded applications
